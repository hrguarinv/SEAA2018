			<h1>A Systematic Mapping on Agile Security Requirements Engineering </h1>
		</div>
		<h3 id="abstract" class="page-header">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
		The rapidly changing business environment in which most companies operate is challenging traditional Requirements Engineering (RE) approaches. The term agile RE has been used to define the ‘‘agile way’’ of conducting RE activities. Security is an essential non-functional requirement that tends to be difficult to address in agile development contexts. The overall understanding of how to handle security requirements in agile contexts is still vague. [Objective] The goal of this paper is to characterize the approaches that have been proposed to handle security requirements in agile software projects. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study. In total, we identified 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria, dated from 2005 to 2017. [Results] We found the approaches propose solutions that may be divided into four categories: modify agile method, extend the concept of user story to abuser story, introduce a lightweight methodology and develop a software framework. We also identified some limitations of using these approaches related to environment, people, effort and resources. [Conclusion] Our analysis suggests that more effort needs to be put into empirically evaluating the solutions and develop specialized software tools in order to mitigate the identified limitations.

		<h3 id="qualitymetrics" class="page-header">Systematic Mapping Protocol</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
		In this research a systematic mapping study was performed following the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters [16]. It was possible to identify the need for the review, to specify the research questions, the research string and the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
		
			<h4>A.	Definition of Research Questions</h4>
		
			The main research question to be answered by this mapping study is: <B>“RQ1. What are the approaches that have been proposed to handle security requirements in software agile projects?”</B>. The following secondary questions were derived from the primary question in order to further characterize the identified approaches.
			<br></br>
			<ol>
				<li value="SQ1">In the context of which agile methods have the approaches been proposed or applied?</li>
				<li value="SQ2">In the context of which software requirement activities have the approaches been proposed or applied?</li>
				<li value="SQ3">How are security requirements handled in each approach?</li>
				<li value="SQ4">Which kind of empirical evaluations have been performed?</li>
				<li value="SQ5">Have the approaches been applied in the industry or academic field?</li>
				<li value="SQ6">What limitations do agile security requirements is facing?</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>B.	Search Strategy</h4>
		
			The defined search string follows: <i>“((Agililty OR Agile OR Scrum OR Extreme Programming) AND (Security AND Requirements))”</i>. It is noteworthy, that the keywords Scrum and Extreme Programming were included because of the popularity of these agile methods during the last few years [2].
		
			<h4>C.	Study Selection</h4>
			
			The search returned many papers that were not relevant for this research. Thus, it was necessary to filter out the irrelevant papers, which required a set of criteria as shown below.

		<h3 id="detectionstrategy" class="page-header">Systematic Mapping Results</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
			This section presents the results of the mapping study. The first subsection provides an overview of the included papers. The following subsections present an overview of research of security requirements in the context of agile projects.
			<h4>A.  Overview of the included papers</h4>
	
			As previously mentioned, we identified 21 studies. The majority of them were published in conferences, journals and symposium as shown in Fig. 2. The largest number of paper, about 55% (12 of them) were published in conferences, 19% (4 of them) in journals, 17% (3 of them) in symposium, 9% (2 only) in workshop and congress.

			<h4>B.  Mapping results obtained</h4>

			It is evident that there are gaps to covers such as the lack of empirically evaluated studies and software framework. In that sense, we present a figure, in order to offer a visualization of the systematic mapping in the form of a bubble chart.
